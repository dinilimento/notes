Since I don't have any domains to purchase an SSL certificate for. I am only providing a step by step on how to create a free certificate with StartSSL.

Signing up with StartSSL
Goto https://www.startssl.com and click the control panel link near the top right
Click the sign up link, assuming you don’t already have an account
Fill in all the required fields
Check your e-mail to obtain the verification code they sent
Complete the registration by entering in the code and clicking continue
Generate a High Grade key, this is only to login, not your certificate
Click the install button and it will install the login certificate in your browser
What you just created is a client side certificate and it is verify yourself to StartSSL, it is an alternative to a more traditional username/password combination and has nothing to do with your SSL certificates.

Provide to StartSSL that you own your domain
Now that you can sign in, you need to begin creating your certificate but first you need to verify you
own the domain. Head over to the control panel and follow the steps below:

Click the Validations Wizard tab
Choose Domain Name Validation from the dropdown list
Enter in your domain name
Select postmaster@productionexample.com from the list and hit continue
Check your e-mail to obtain the verification code they sent
Complete the validation process by entering in the code and clicking continue
Create your certificate
With verification out of the way, you can go ahead and generate the certificate. Head over to the
control panel and follow the steps below:

Click the Certificates Wizard tab
Choose Web Server SSL/TLS Certificate from the dropdown list
Click skip when it comes time to generate the private key
We want to generate our own key so StartSSL does not know it
Move into the deploy/production/certs folder
In a terminal, run the following 2 commands:
openssl genrsa 2048 > productionexample.key
openssl req -new -key productionexample.key -out csr.pem
Enter in the Common Name that you used earlier in the validation process
Open csr.pem in your favorite editor and copy it to your clipboard
Paste the contents of your clipboard into the textarea on StartSSL
Click continue to submit your certificate request file
Select the domain name you validated earlier
Enter in www as a subdomain that you want this to also work on
Confirm everything by clicking continue
You may or may not need to wait an hour for StartSSL to verify it
Copy the contents of that textarea to a file named productionexample-raw.crt
This is your certificate, do not lose it!
Create a proper certificate chain
In order to get A+ SSL certificate status you need to create a certificate chain. It will be a combination
of your certificate and StartSSL’s intermediary certificate.

Download StartSSL’s intermediary certificate:
wget https://www.startssl.com/certs/class1/sha2/pem/sub.class1.server.sha2.ca.pem

Concatenate your certificate with theirs:
cat productionexample-raw.crt sub.class1.server.sha2.ca.pem > productionexample.crt
